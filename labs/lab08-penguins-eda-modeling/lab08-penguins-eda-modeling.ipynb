    "# Lab 08: Penguins EDA & Simple Modeling\n",

    "**ING3513 - Introduction to Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning**\n",
    "\n",
    "A hands-on practice session to apply EDA and modeling skills from Lab 07 to the **Palmer Penguins** dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Palmer Penguins dataset contains measurements for three penguin species (Adelie, Chinstrap, Gentoo) observed on islands in Antarctica. The typical machine learning task with this dataset is to **predict the species** based on physical features like bill length, bill depth, flipper length, and body mass.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab is very open ended. The goal is simply to have a playground to explore how the tools actually work without many examples. You are encouraged to use AI to help understand. Recommended pattern:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Figure out what you want to do. E.g., plot a histogram.\n",
    "2. Search or check previous labs for how to do that.\n",
    "3. Try to implement it yourself.\n",
    "4. If you are stuck, ask a co-student or a teacher.\n",
    "5. Use AI if still stuck\n",
    "6. Use AI to explain and understand is always encouraged. Try to always understand every single line of code.\n",
