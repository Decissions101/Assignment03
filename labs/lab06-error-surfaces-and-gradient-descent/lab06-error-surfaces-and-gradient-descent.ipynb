    "- **Why this matters** — every deep learning model you'll ever use trains this way\n",

    "In Lab 05, you saw that changing weights $w_1, w_2$ and bias $\\beta$ moves the decision boundary. You manually tuned these parameters to find the **diagonal line** that separated Pine from Birch — using **both** grain prominence and brightness.\n",

    "\n",
    "**One powerful answer:** Follow the **negative gradient** — the direction of steepest descent on the error surface. This is called **gradient descent**, and it's by far the most widely used optimization method in machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** There are other optimization algorithms (e.g., Newton's method, evolutionary algorithms, closed-form solutions for simple models), but gradient descent dominates modern ML because it scales well to millions of parameters.\n",

    "- Random initialization can lead to different (and sometimes bad) solutions\n",

    "**Mitigation strategies:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Random restarts** — try many initializations, pick the best result\n",
    "2. **Better initialization** — use smart starting points (e.g., Xavier, He initialization)\n",
    "3. **Momentum** — help gradient descent \"roll through\" small bumps\n",
    "4. **Adaptive learning rates** — algorithms like Adam that adjust step size automatically\n",
    "5. **Stochastic gradient descent** — noise from mini-batches can help escape shallow local minima\n"
